# Other Notes & Information

* **For PWAs:** Abandoning non Chrome users is a very valid trade off to make based on the business decision but we should be basing this on statistics like the % of web users using Chrome. But keep in mind this trade off will include abandoning Safari on iOS too. Read about pitfalls on [caniuse.com](https://www.caniuse.com)
* **For Electron:** Again, abandoning mobile is a very valid tradeoff to make as well but the problem is the lack of testing libraries. We need to identify best practices of testing Electron.
* One option - make a gut decision and pick one. Switching from Electron to PWA is easier than vice versa. A caveat is that we might not want to do TDD.
* Prof. Powell recommends - do a bake off and make an alpha version in both Electron and PWA.
