# Summary


## Issue

We want to use a test framework to test the electron version of our application:

  * The main problem with testing Electron apps is the lack of established and updated frameworks. 

  * While there was once support by **Spectron** to test electron apps, that was only till Electron version 13, and has been completely deprecated as of today.

  * The best alternative to Spectron is **Playwright**: a framework created and maintained by Microsoft, and moreover integrated with TypeScript.
  * Playwright has experimental Electron support via Electron's support for the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP). More info [here](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/automated-testing#using-playwright). 



## Decision

Decided on Microsoft Playwright to write tests for our electron app. Playwright launches the app in development mode and has access to the main process module.


## Status

Keeping Playwright as our default testing framework. Open to alternatives, but it seems that there are no other alternatives available that are as competent as playwright.


## Details


### Assumptions

We wanted to have a mechanism that will test our electron app as easily as the PWA version. We decided to use playwright because of the following reasons - 

* It is both open-source and seems to have Electron support baked in. 
* Playwright works similar to other testing frameworks (Selenium, Cypress), i.e. it launches the actual application and mimics the actions a user would do, clicking on elements, writing things in text inputs, going through different flows.
* Assertions are added to make sure the expected results happen in the UI â€” for example, the opening of a panel or changing a label. 
* Although more time-consuming, launching an application in this way is preferable to running it from source code, since this more closely mimics the end-user experience. 


### Constraints

While playwright does support end-to-end testing of electron, the support is still experimental. There are a lot of things that playwright still doesn't allow us to do.

For example, when clicking the save button, electron opens a save file dialog where the user must input a file name and select the location to save the file. This action happens outside the context of electron and is very difficult to mimic in playwright.


### Positions

* We were able to write tests for the rendering process of our application to check if each element is rendered correctly.

```javascript
test.describe('Render the first page', async () => { 
    test('text elements exist', async () => { 
        expect(await page. $('#main' )).toBeTruthy(); 
        expect(await page. $('#title')).toBeTruthy(); 
        expect(await page. $('#textarea')).toBeTruthy(); 
        expect (await page. $('#fileLoader')).toBeTruthy();
    });

    test('buttons exists', async () => {
        expect(await page. $('#button-group')).toBeTruthy();
        expect(await page. $('#new-file')).toBeTruthy();
        expect(await page. $('#upload-file')).toBeTruthy();
        expect(await page. $('#save-file')).toBeTruthy();
    });
}
``` 
* We also needed tests for the file handling modules, but it was difficult to interact with the file handling module which uses native system dialogs.

```javascript
test('new file button', async () => {
  // check new-file button
  await page.click('#new-file');
  const title = await page.inputValue('#title');
  expect(title).toBe('');
  const content = await page.inputValue('#textarea');
  expect(content).toBe('');
});
```

### Argument

Currently there seem to be no other alternative to Playwright, and it is better to test our system functionality using everything that Playwright allows us to do.

Playwright allows us to perform testing satisfactorily but is not completely free from hiccups.
