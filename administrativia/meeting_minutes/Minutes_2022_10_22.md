## Agenda Items

Item | Description
---- | ----
Brainstorm ideas for JS Demos | • Debate on which features/components of JS could be used to create demos<br>• Discuss relevance of these features with our project



## Other Notes & Information
* **Motivation behind selected JS Demos** -
  * **Web Workers** - Webworkers could help in performing background tasks for the note keeping app without hampering the UI thread. Some dabbling with these could potentially be useful for the app.
  * **Indexed DB** - An in browser NOSQL database could potentially be useful in storing the recent notes/files opened by the user. An exploration in this path could help in realizing this functionality.
  * **Canvas API**  - 2D canvas could potentially be useful for UI elements.
  * **Closures** - Using variables declared in surrounding environments (like maybe parent functions) is an interesting programming construct and could potentially be useful for the note-keeping app.
