## Other Notes & Information
* **Noteworthy Goals** -
  * Understand what Farley's saying about the topic and make our own notes on this.
  * Write code samples explaining the concepts which in our case is on cohesion
  * We could try to convert the Java code samples that Farley has provided
  * The domain specific Java code samples are context dependent since the Java relies on directly reading a file from the system but that's not something most JS devs might do, they might directly parse a file from the input of a user.
  * We can (and maybe should) highlight these points while making the PPT
  * Lastly, if the Java samples aren't working out for us in JS, then make our own code samples for the same, preferably on codepen
  * Finalize the gifs, memes and pictures to the slides to make them look interesting
  * Add quotes in slides to personalities referenced in the chapter. Also add relevant metaphors for the technical concepts described in the chapter by Farley.
  * Add personal opinions too in the slides - Not necessarily have to be aligned with Farley. If someone has a unique POV, that can be included in the presentation.
