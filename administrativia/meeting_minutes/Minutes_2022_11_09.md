# Other Notes & Information

* We need to assign the task of managing builds to a single team member who can work on the deployment pipelines. We'll need to support - units, integration and document geneneration.
* Our dual track approach ideally would culminate in a way we have both electron PWA repos merging so we have both finally.
* Since we're handling two technologies together, we'll need to pull up our socks with respect to development.
* In the end, a single code base should generate both - the Electron JS app as well as the Progressive Web app.
