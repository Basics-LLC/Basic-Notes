## Other Notes & Information
* It is important to be able to elicit why we took a certain decision and if we can't justify them with an empirical justification of why we made the particular decision then it is poor software engineering practice
* For this reason, it is also important to explore other technologies which could also be potentially helpful to our usecase. 
* Writing a few toy programs in such alternative approaches can help us understand why this technology is/is not helpful to us.
* By weighing these pros and cons, we make an informed decision and have a valid justification in hand as to why we did what we did.
* To support the above details we will need to provide ADRs or MADRs which should shortly cover any major decisions.
*  Another action item is to get our basic repo set up along with linting, actions, etc.
